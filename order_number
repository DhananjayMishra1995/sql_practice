order_number is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about the order ID and the customer ID.
 

Write an SQL query to find the customer_number for the customer who has placed the largest number of orders.

The test cases are generated so that exactly one customer will have placed more orders than any other customer.





SOLUTION -
SELECT 
    customer_number
FROM
    (# Write your MySQL query statement below
    SELECT
        customer_number,
        COUNT(customer_number) as count_of_orders
    FROM
        orders
    Group bY
        customer_number
    ORDER by count_of_orders DESC
    LIMIT 1
    ) as t1
